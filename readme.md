# `nixfiles`

This repo contains all my nix config (except secrets). It is maximally WIP
as of 9/16/2024, but I've been using it exclusively for my laptop since ~April
2024. If you see something awful please reach out, open an issue or preferrably
DM me on any of my socials. I'm learning nix as I go.

The history is destroyed prior to this commit because I commited secrets when I
was getting started. :3

[misterio77/nix-starter-config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs)
minimal template for impermanence.
